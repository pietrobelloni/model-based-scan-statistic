# model-based-scan-statistic
This code can be used to reproduce the simulations presented in the article _A model-based scan statistic with enhanced specificity for detecting spatial clusters of high mortality risk_ by E. Bovo, P. Belloni, A. Sottosanti e G. Boccuzzo.

For privacy reasons, sharing the data used in the simulation is not possible. Therefore, in the .Rdata file, we only provide synthetic data similar to those used for simulations.
